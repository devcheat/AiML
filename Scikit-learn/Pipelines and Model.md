# Module 6: Pipelines and Model Deployment

## 1. Building Pipelines
Pipelines are a way to streamline the machine learning workflow by chaining together multiple preprocessing steps and a model into a single object. This simplifies the process of training and deploying machine learning models.

Example of building a pipeline with feature scaling and logistic regression:
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Define the pipeline with preprocessing steps and model
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])

# Train the pipeline on the training data
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the pipeline
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## 2. Saving and Loading Models
Once a model is trained, you can save it to disk for future use without needing to retrain it. Scikit-learn provides utilities for saving and loading trained models.

Example of saving and loading a model:
```python
import joblib

# Save the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(pipeline, 'model.pkl')

# Load the saved model from file
loaded_model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

# Use the loaded model to make predictions
y_pred = loaded_model.predict(X_test)
```

Certainly! Let's delve into Module 7: Advanced Topics, covering the three points mentioned:
