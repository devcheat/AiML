# Module 1: Introduction to Scikit-learn

## 1. Installation and Setup
Scikit-learn can be easily installed using pip, the Python package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Once installed, you can import scikit-learn into your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks using:

```python
import sklearn
```

## 2. Overview of Scikit-learn's Features
Scikit-learn provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for machine learning tasks. Some of its key features include:

- Simple and consistent API: Scikit-learn provides a unified interface for various machine learning algorithms, making it easy to experiment with different models without needing to learn a new API for each algorithm.
  
- Supervised and unsupervised learning: It supports both supervised learning (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction).
  
- Data preprocessing: Scikit-learn includes utilities for data preprocessing, such as feature scaling, normalization, imputation of missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
  
- Model evaluation and selection: It offers tools for model selection and evaluation, including cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning with grid search, and various metrics for assessing model performance.

## 3. Basic Concepts: Estimators, Transformers, and Predictors
Scikit-learn follows a consistent naming convention for its components:

- **Estimators**: Estimators are objects that can estimate parameters based on a dataset. The main API implemented by this package is that of Estimator objects, which can be trained on data using the `fit` method.

Example:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create an instance of the LinearRegression estimator
estimator = LinearRegression()

# Fit the estimator to the training data
estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Transformers**: Transformers are objects that can transform data. They have a `transform` method that takes input data and returns transformed data.

Example:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create an instance of the StandardScaler transformer
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the transformer to the training data and transform it
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the test data using the same scaler
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

- **Predictors**: Predictors are objects that can make predictions based on input data. They have a `predict` method that takes input data and returns predictions.

Example:
```python
# Assuming we have a trained model already
# Make predictions on new data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

These are the basic building blocks of scikit-learn, and understanding them will help you effectively use the library for various machine learning tasks.

Of course! Let's dive into Module 2: Data Handling with Scikit-learn, covering the two points mentioned:
