# Module 7: Advanced Topics

## 1. Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods combine multiple base models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Random Forests and Gradient Boosting are popular ensemble methods implemented in scikit-learn.

Example using Random Forests for classification:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier
rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the classifier on the training data
rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## 2. Neural Network Models with Scikit-learn
While scikit-learn primarily focuses on traditional machine learning algorithms, it also provides a simple neural network implementation through the `MLPClassifier` and `MLPRegressor` classes.

Example using Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for classification:
```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create an instance of the MLPClassifier
mlp_classifier = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100,), max_iter=1000, random_state=42)

# Train the classifier on the training data
mlp_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = mlp_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the classifier
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## 3. Custom Estimators and Transformers
Scikit-learn allows you to create custom estimators and transformers by implementing specific methods (`fit`, `transform`, `fit_transform`, `predict`, etc.). This flexibility enables you to extend scikit-learn's functionality to suit your specific needs.

Example of a custom transformer:
```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin

class CustomTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, custom_parameter=1):
        self.custom_parameter = custom_parameter

    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Custom logic for fitting the transformer
        return self

    def transform(self, X):
        # Custom transformation logic
        return X * self.custom_parameter

# Example usage
custom_transformer = CustomTransformer(custom_parameter=2)
X_transformed = custom_transformer.fit_transform(X)
```

In this example, `CustomTransformer` is a custom transformer that multiplies each feature by a custom parameter. You can create custom estimators in a similar manner by implementing the necessary methods for fitting and predicting.

These advanced topics expand your toolkit for tackling more complex machine learning tasks and provide greater flexibility in model development and customization within scikit-learn.
